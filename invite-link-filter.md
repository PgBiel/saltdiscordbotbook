#Invite Link Filter
A basic feature that hopes to help you get rid of those weird link dudes. Sure, there are always ways of bypassing, but you can punish those, can't you? ;)
####Permissions
- `global.toggleinvites` -> Access to the `+toggleinvites` command.
_(Note: Can also be used if you have `Manage Messages` and the permission is not negated for you.)_

##How to use
It's as simple as doing `+toggleinvites`. It will toggle the filter.

##Troubleshooting
If people can still send invite links normally, please check if Salt has Manage Messages. Also check if it can Read Message History and Read Messages. There sure are ways to bypass the filter, but a basic filter to keep the person wary won't hurt, right? ;)
